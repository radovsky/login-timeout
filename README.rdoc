A Rails app that will only allow users a certain number of unsuccessful login attempts in a given time period before forcing them to wait before attempting again. To modify failed_login_mins (minutes from first failed login until failed login attempts are cleared) and lockout_mins (minutes user will be locked out after three unsuccessful login attempts), see line 13 in app/assets/controllers/sessions_controller.rb. To run Capybara tests, do 'bundle exec rspec'.
